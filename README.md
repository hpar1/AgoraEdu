# AgoraEdu
AgoraEdu is a college posting board where students can make sales, organize groups, and build community on college campuses.

These are the backend files used to create the AgoraEdu mobile application at CitrusHack 2018. 
They utilize Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Knex.js and the Twilio SMS api to create a service for handling requests regarding
the app's functionality and sending out notifications using the Twilio SMS api.

Worked on by Hamza Parekh(Request handling, encryption and databasing) and Carlos Olea(API integration and databasing)
